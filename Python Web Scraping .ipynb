Instead of buying homes using traditional real estate agents, we are creating a self-service model where buyers can do most of the work themselves and earn 2% of the listing price as a reward.  Think of it this way, MassRealty is looking to take money from a broken system (everyone hates salesy real estate agents) and give it back to the middle class.  In essence, a $10k rebate for anyone who buys a $500k average home.  With that money, consumers can pay for their kidsâ college fund, fix their kitchen, use it as a safety net, or anything they wish.  \n",

Phuc has started 5 companies over 20 years and has seen the tech industry change from requiring $20M+/100+ developers to build a product to only $800k/4 developers in his last startup.  Now, we have finally reached the golden age where a few developers can build amazing products in a few months and you will be learning from a master coder how to do this.\n",

      "\n",
      "We are a digital agency headquartered in Amesbury, MA. For 20+ years, we've been steadily growing and creating high quality, award winning web applications, branding, and marketing solutions for companies across all industries. \n",
      "\n",
      "As a Web Engineer, you'll be working on a production team of about 8, including project managers, creatives, UX professionals, front-end developers, and engineers. In this position, you will make an impact on multiple active projects and constantly collaborate with others on the team. The immediate need for this role is working with the team to update internal business systems and content tools using the Laravel PHP framework. \n",
      "\n",
      "We're looking for someone who loves dabbling in new technologies, building out back-end services, and collaborating on integration challenges.

      "\n",
      "What We Value\n",
      "\n",
      "- Collaboration and Constant Refinement â While we pride ourselves on having a solid process, tools, and plans, there's no substitute for a great collaborator. As you were building out your last project, if you're able to respond to a change in plan and collaborate with the creative or UX team to find an even better solution, you'll fit in well here.\n",
      "- Innovators (not really Inventors) â Nothing should start with a blank slate. We try to build upon past success, use the best community resources, and think in terms of reusable solutions that can be drawn up in the future. There are so many full-stack resources and tools available today. We're looking for someone equally pragmatic and creative.\n",
      "- Autonomy â Everyone on the team you'll be working on is completely empowered. We want to share, motivate, and hold each other accountable.\n",
      "- Supportive â If you're used to jumping across a couple projects and willing to help out where you're needed most, you'll find other kindred spirits at Imarc. \n",
      "\n",
      "Skills We're Looking For\n",
      "\n",
      "As a Web Engineer, there's a chance to work across a very broad cross section of technology. Maybe you don't have years of experience in all of these skills or tools, but the desire to learn them is just as important.\n",
      "\n",
      "- Very comfortable with Git, SSH, Composer and NPM\n",
      "- Modern PHP 7 and Laravel\n",
      "- Good understanding of Databases and SQL\n",
      "- QA and Unit/Integration Testing (PHPStan, PHPUnit) and Browser Testing\n",
      "- Some JavaScript and VueJS\n",

      "What Imarc Offers\n",
      "\n",
      "This is a great opportunity to work with other engineers, UX professionals, and designers in a highly collaborative and quality-focused environment. Youâll be able to learn and grow through working on challenging problems across a varied set of project. We're a stable agency that's been around for over 20 years. We've grown slowly and steadily with very low employee turnover. We've been voted one of Inc. Magazine's best workplaces a couple times.\n",
      "\n",
      "We also offer lots of tangible benefits that you're probably interested in: \n",
      "\n",
      "- Paid vacation and personal time\n",
      "- Attractive benefits package including health and dental coverage\n",
      "- Pre-tax Flexible Spending Account (FSA) planning\n",

Instead of buying homes using traditional real estate agents, we are creating a self-service model where buyers can do most of the work themselves and earn 2% of the listing price as a reward.  Think of it this way, MassRealty is looking to take money from a broken system (everyone hates salesy real estate agents) and give it back to the middle class.  In essence, a $10k rebate for anyone who buys a $500k average home.  With that money, consumers can pay for their kidsâ college fund, fix their kitchen, use it as a safety net, or anything they wish.  \n",

Phuc has started 5 companies over 20 years and has seen the tech industry change from requiring $20M+/100+ developers to build a product to only $800k/4 developers in his last startup.  Now, we have finally reached the golden age where a few developers can build amazing products in a few months and you will be learning from a master coder how to do this.\n",

      "Integrated Statistics is looking for a Data Management Coordinator to work with National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) National Marine Fisheries Service (NMFS) Northeast Fisheries Science Center (NEFSC) and Greater Atlantic Regional Field Office (GARFO). The Data Management Coordinator will work directly with staff from GARFO, NEFSC, and the Atlantic Coastal Cooperative Statistics Program (ACCSP) on a database merger project that will incorporate state fisheries data into a single comprehensive database for all US commercial fisheries catch in the Northeast.\n",
      "\n",
      "This position may be located in Woods Hole, MA or in Gloucester, MA. The position may begin with a period of remote work, to accommodate pandemic restrictions. \n",
      "\n",
      "Currently, NEFSC and GARFO have two parallel systems for catch monitoring and accounting, with the GARFO-led system focusing on quota monitoring and the NEFSC-led system supporting stock assessments and other research activities. The two systems each integrate data across a wide array of fishery information systems, and each approaches that integration slightly differently. Both systems require significant maintenance and upgrading as regulations and data streams change frequently. The Catch Accounting and Monitoring System (CAMS) implementation team is creating a single comprehensive database for all federal Northeast US fisheries catch.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Data Management Coordinator will work with the CAMS Project Manager and state natural resource managers to incorporate state data that is reported to ACCSP into CAMS. The Data Coordinator will also develop the technical specifications that ensure state data reporting to ACCSP is at a sufficient level of detail to allow incorporation in the CAMS database. The state data will remain housed at ACCSP, but will be linked to GARFO via relational database tables that integrate state fisheries-dependent data into CAMS.\n",
      "\n",
      "Duties\n",
      "The task includes but is not limited to these duties:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Coordinating the inclusion of state fisheries catch and effort data, including working with states to ensure their data reporting to ACCSP is at a sufficient level of detail to allow incorporation into the CAMS database.\n",
      "    Coordinating accurate, complete, and timely transfer of state level data from ACCSP to the CAMS database.\n",
      "    Working with the internal CAMS project team to develop a data management plan that outlines data capture, data flow, data queries, manual checks, and data listing to ensure data integrity.\n",
      "    Developing a process/method to ensure ACCSPâs Quality Assurance/Quality Control (QA/QC) program provides timely feedback and correction of state data that parallels GARFOâs QA/QC program in coordination with the CAMS project team.\n",
      "    Working with data scientists to develop data management and visualization tools, including gathering/defining user requirements and performing user testing.\n",
      "\n",
      "Qualifications and Skills\n",
      "The Data Management Coordinator must:\n",
      "\n",
      "    Demonstrate proficiency in designing, creating, and implementing Oracle database systems.\n",
      "    Possess strong programming and development skills using PL/SQL (package, procedures, functions, triggers) and batch coding skills.\n",
      "    Possess the ability to manage large datasets, query, extract, and organize data in useful ways to reduce performance related issues.\n",
      "    Have experience in code migration, database change management and data management in multiple environments and different stages of the development life cycle.\n",
      "    Possess experience with data backup, data recovery, data dictionaries, and data standardization processes.\n",
      "    Possess the ability to handle multiple projects and deadlines with flexibility between tasks.\n",
      "    Have a track record of ensuring performance, security, integrity, and availability of databases.\n",
      "    Be able to support application development through integrated project work group meetings, data modeling, code reviews, and system reviews for quality and performance.\n",
      "    Demonstrate ability to work with management and developers in providing quick resolutions during critical production issues with performance related resolutions.\n",
      "    Implement and integrate security standards set by the NOAA/NMFS/ Office of the Chief Information Officer (OCIO).\n",
      "    Possess excellent written and oral communication skills..\n",
      "\n",
